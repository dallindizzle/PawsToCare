# PawsToCare
### Full stack web application made for a veterinary practice. Has Home, About, and Contact Us pages. Includes a login system that allows pet owners and veterinarians to login and view tables of animals and owners. Pet owners can log in and view tables of their pets. Veterinarians can log in and view tables of all pets and all owners in the database. Pets tables gets its data from the server via AJAX and has client side sorting, filtering, and pagination. Each pet entry has a button which will display a modal that shows the owner(s) of the pet. The owners table is mostly server side so its filtering and pagination components are done in the backend. Owners table also has a button which displays a modal that shows the pets that are associated with that owner. App also includes a Jasmine testing component which tests the sorting and filtering. Scripts were made using FakerJS to generate fake data to populate the database.
